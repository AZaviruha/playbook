___As Nipun Mehta said: "When one foot walks, the other foot rests. Doing and being have to be in balance"___ .Part of our culture is what we do and how we do it. Here are some of our actions as a company to keep our culture alive and well.

## Weekly Meeting
Once a week we do a company-wide meeting so teams can tell the whole company what they've been doing and what can be improved. We know meetings are usually a waste of time, so we share as much knowledge in as little time as possible. This meeting is split into two moments: 
- a timeboxed one that lasts at most 45 minutes for projects to share what was learned;
- an open one that can take as much time as needed for technical debates.
The questions below help the teams know what lessons they should bring to the weekly:
```
- Did you start any new process on your project this week?
- What did the team do that was not project related?
- Is there some issue that you want the whole company's opinion on?
- What is about to happen? How does the future look for your project?
- Did anyone do anything cool and worth noting? Kudos them!


[Technical Debate]
- Was there a technical challenge on the project this week? How did you solve it?

- Is there any piece of code worth showing?
```

Aside from that, every three months the meeting has a different format to encompass a more high-end discussion between managers and mentors. Instead of the regular questions about the day-to-day of the project, the managers and anyone with at least one mentee are encouraged to bring answers to these questions:
```
**Mentors**
- How is mentoring going? What is a good practice that you are doing and that you think other people should think about too?
- Was there a link/content that you forwarded your mentee that you think it's useful to everyone?

**Managers**
- Was there an activity that you had a lot of trouble doing at first but now it's effortless?
- Were there improvements in tracking metrics on your project? How was that?
- What A/B tests performed were worth noting? What lessons did you learn about A/B testing by doing them?
- Were there any changes in project architecture?
- Is there any new tool was introduced to the project?
- Is there any new framework or lib that was added to the project?
```

## Open Source
We are community people, open source contributions are wonderful  and everyone is encouraged to do some. Since a lot of our coding uses open-source tools, maintaining our own open-source projects seems reasonable. So we encourage people to contribute as projects demands. We find that is one way to leave our company's mark in the community as well is to always fork using [Vinta's Github account](https://github.com/vintasoftware).

## Conferences
Community is not only about producing open-source software (and playbooks), conferences are part of it as well. People are encouraged to give back as much as they can. With the interest of developing further exchange with other professionals, Vinta will buy tickets for any technical conferences deemed worthy by the employees, and if one of ours approves a talk in a conference, whether it's local or international, she/he is granted a bonus for their further collaboration in sustaining the community we are a part of. Keeping an eye on conference's submission deadlines helps everyone in doing so.

## Blog posts
We keep our blog updated. It helps twofold, we train people on how to write passing on what they've learned, and people from the community see Vinta as a reference, checking us for tips often. That's why whoever learns anything gets incentives to write it down. We count on everyone to keep an eye and say: "I think that's worth a blogpost!" whether in our day-to-day or in a weekly meeting.

## Pyzza Internal talks
Every 15 days we gather some people to discuss a topic of interest. This is a very good moment for people to hone their presentation skills, study about something they like, and spread their diverse learnings around the company. It's also another good moment for those "I think that's worth a blogpost!" quotes. Beer and pizza are on us!

## Courses and Books
Just name it, Vinta will buy technical books and courses (online and offline) for anyone. It helps to sustain  the learning atmosphere weâ€™ve come to believe in.  A delightful not-too-farfetched chaos theory bit: a book read turns into a blogpost, that turns into a better delivery for our client, that turns into a new client.
