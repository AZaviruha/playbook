# Hiring: speeding-up your way to Vinta

You can implement a project and get a head-start on everyone else!

Explaining: knowing how to choose a good programmer is a very difficult task. There is not a single way that works for most companies and there is a lot of talk about why one way is better than the other. For us, the process is divided in three parts, the third being a small project. When the project is given to a candidate, we also state that itâ€™s to evaluate **good software practices, testing and problem solving skills**. In order to mimic our open-scope environment we set a initial deadline that can be rescheduled if more time is needed (when correctly reported, this saves both the candidate and us a lot of stress).

## What you need to do?

* Read carefully every requirement on the specification;
* Make sure you understood was is a necessary requirement and what is optional;
* Setup a github/bitbucket repository for your code;
* Deploy your project on a host service (we recommend [heroku](https://heroku.com/));
* When you finish the project and feel it's ready, [apply here!](https://vintasoftware.typeform.com/to/Xb6aIu)

## Specifications for the project

Here you can check the [requirements of the project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Evi-kghklIcwJ33SFqPyGREB4OVfNJXX4EOfrWuhhwY/edit?usp=sharing). It's in portuguese cause we don't want the candidate to misunderstand anything (that could lead to a final delivery that doesn't match the expectations and we'd miss the candidate only because of a misunderstanding).
