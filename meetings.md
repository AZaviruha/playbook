Along with providing the very best service while coding, __customer relationship is the most important thing in a project__ and meetings are a very important part of it.

## Scheduling
Use some app to make sure you are scheduling meetings for  the correct programmed time. We recommend World Time Buddy, which has mobile phone apps:

**Always send a calendar invite**. No matter how quick you plan the meeting to be, make sure you send an invite. This is important so you and the client never miss a meeting. Also, too many meetings are harmful to both sides' productivity. Clients should get used to scheduling meetings beforehand and not just hop in for a call at any time.

## Calendar notifications
You should configure your calendar to send you notifications one day before (e-mail) and 30 minutes before (preferably on your phone). [Here is how](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37242?hl=en) to configure the default notification scheme for your calendar. This is important so you don't miss the meeting and have time to check if everything is well.

## During the meeting
- When you speak to the client, you're the voice of the company. You must be professional.
- Try not to be too informal. Avoid the excessive use of slang.
- Never say something is easy or simple to implement. Instead, state what are your thoughts at a first glance, but you'll have to confirm after contacting the team.
- If you don't know how to answer something, say you will verify and answer after the meeting. Don't forget: track that.
- Never lie, be transparent when something goes wrong.
- Have your camera at the height of your eyes and in front of you. Although this is a video meeting it should feel that you are looking face to face with the person. You will give a more professional impression and the client will feel more confident because you are "looking them in the eyes" and not facing the screen in a weird position. In other words, you should use your laptop as the primary screen and have it lifted so the height of the camera is the same as your eyes.

## After the meeting
- Review your notes and add tasks to Asana. Remember if you said you would send something later to client and make sure it happens.
- Make sure there's a written version of the things discussed and decided for further reference. This should also be made accessible to the client (Asana cards help here as well).
