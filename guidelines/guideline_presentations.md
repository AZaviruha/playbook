## Slides Tips

- Start talking about yourself and what you do:
    - Who are you?
        - Your name
        - Experience
        - Things you like to work with
    - About Vinta:
        - What we do?
        - What projects have we worked on?
        - Why do you like working at Vinta?
    - Have an slide to talk about open source projects you've worked on.
    - Let people know you are available during the conference to talk about yourself, the presentation or Vinta.
- Translate any citations to the language you are presenting on, otherwise you are going to have a hard time trying to translate them during the presentation. It's a lot easier to just read them.
- The last slide should contain:
    - A shortened link to your slides (remember to upload it before the presentation)
    - Your contact information: Twitter, GitHub, etc
- Keep last slide open while people make questions.
- After the last slide, add answers to the questions you that are very likely to be asked.
- If you are not confident about how long the talk will last, move 1 or 2 sections of the presentation after the "thank you slide". In case you finish early, just keep going through the extra topics and then go back to the "thank you slide".

## Presentation Strategy Ideas

- Live coding (only do it if you are very confident you can do it).
- Screen Recording. Record your screen doing live coding or showing things and play the recording during the presentation while you explain things.

- Jupyter Notebook. This is a nice intermediary between live coding and playing a screen recording.

- Story telling. Start by giving context about a story and move through your topics as you tell that story.

    - [hunter2: A Symphony of Password Horror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLuMLoD4jzY)
- List of topics. You can just have a list of topics organized in a well thought sequence. Ideally, those are organized in way that things connect toghether.

- Read the transcript. You can write down in slide notes the transcript of what you want to say and read those during the presentation. Be aware that requires **A LOT** of previous preparation for it to seem natural.

## After Presentation Questions Tips

- If you want you can tell the room manager to that you will not be taking questions after the presentation.
- If someone asks as question that you did not understand it's fine to ask them to re-state the question.
- If you don't know how to respond to a question it's ok to say you don't know the answer. A good idea is to ask the person to chat privately after the presentation. Eg.: "I don't have experience with that but would love to hear your opinions, can we chat after the talk?"
