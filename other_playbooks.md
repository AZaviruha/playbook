# Other playbooks
Alongside the books we read, we also devoted a lot of time to research other playbooks and how other companies choose to open their methodologies and culture for the world to see. Their approach and playbooks vary widely, but the important thing is everyone is contributing to raising the level of process discussion worldwide and choosing openness instead of secrecy.

- [Y Combinator](https://playbook.samaltman.com/) - One of the few, if not the only, playbook from an investment company that we could find. They focus on sharing the knowledge they acquired from helping several startups succeed. Its chapters are well decoupled from each other and can bring valuable lessons 

- [Sophilabs](https://www.notion.so/Playbook-956e7c5ff4b544f4be17fde1dc8d895d) - Sophilabs focused a lot of their playbook on how to better your craft as a developer and how to interact with the tools they have, from text-editors to how their project management tool. It's an excellent way to create a dialogue about why and how to use the tools at your disposal.

- [Basecamp](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook) - We've also quoted Basecamp's printed book last section, but their playbook is also worth noting and has a lot to teach. They have found a nice workaround to the problem of letting some subjects open and stir the discussion without compromising some more sensible data. 

- [Valve](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf) - Valve shares with us a very distinct way of looking at management and how we share information inside the company. Their playbook has a cheerful approach and acknowledges that these changes are not always a bed of roses, but you can ponder the trade-offs and make either side work.

- [Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/) - Thought it's organized more like a standalone site than properly a playbook, Google's Rework gives us quite a lot of insight in researches that they've done and how that affects their processes. This level of openness that shares even knowledge is one of the reasons Google is a reference in our field.

[Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/playbook) - Thoughtbot's playbook is structured to cover all the phases of their production process. Dividing it by phase makes it easier for people to go exactly where they want. Although focusing less on the internal operations of the company, their takes on sales, hiring, and apprenticeship are well worth the reading.

[Luminary Labs](http://www.slideshare.net/LuminaryLabs/the-human-company-playbook-version-10) - Before this playbook existed, Sara Holoubek did an excellent job advocating lengthy about how companies could go above the minimum line of benefits and start behaving more humanely. Recently they compiled not only their practices but also practices from multiple other companies. They are divided into sections that explain the importance of each benefit while listing many different ways that an interested company might implement them. It's a must read if you are interested in what benefits companies could offer.

[Fullstack Labs](https://www.fullstacklabs.co/playbook) -Fullstack's playbook also focuses on the steps of their production process. They bring examples of each phase for both clients and partners to see what are the outcomes on each part of their process. This helps less experienced people a lot, as they can understand the difference and importance of each step in the whole process. 

[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook) - Atlassian did an outstanding visual job on their playbook. Almost every part of the process, what they call "plays", is documented and has a video explaining how it works. The playbook is also full of templated documents that anyone can download and a set of tips to be read before testing the practices yourself. Although way more difficult to interact and generate a discussion than a typical, open-source playbook, Atlassian's compilation shows there is always a benefit if you can include more people in the conversation with different ways to show the same content.

[Wemake](https://wemake.services/meta/rsdp) - Wemake has several definitions of their playbook, they chose to bring a lot of necessary technical clarifications to a more open discussion, such as "the definition of done", "creating issues", "closing issues" and so on. Another interesting thing they do is set Dealbreakers: criteria that define what types of clients they won't work with. We realize not all companies can do it, and need to work with anything just to keep the head above the water, but we also believe more companies should be doing something like this.
